# Product-Review-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning-via-Python-3
#Try to relaize some algorithms to analysis the product reviews
#The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of #reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been #adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively. 
#In the project, I'll implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.
#Use the trained classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.
#Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.
